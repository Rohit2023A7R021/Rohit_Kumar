# Wireshark Experiment — TLS Packet Capture & Analysis

This repository documents an experiment involving **Wireshark**, **TLS protocol analysis**, and **packet capturing/filtering**.
The goal of this lab is to observe how TLS secures HTTPS communication by encrypting data exchanged between a client and a server.

---

## 🧰 Tools and Techniques Used

1. **Wireshark** – Packet capturing and analysis tool
2. **TLS Protocol** – Secure protocol used in HTTPS communication
3. **Packet Capturing & Filtering** – Capturing traffic and applying filters such as `tls`, `tcp`, `ip.addr == <target-ip>` etc.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology Used

### **1. Set Environment**

Prepared a system with internet access and administrative permissions to allow packet capture.

### **2. Install Wireshark**

Installed Wireshark using package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install wireshark
```

### **3. Start Capturing Packets**

Launched Wireshark and allowed necessary permissions for full packet capture.

### **4. Open Wireshark and Select Active Network Interface**

Selected the correct network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`) that carries internet traffic.

### **5. Visit an HTTPS Website**

Opened a browser and visited a secure website (e.g., **[https://google.com](https://google.com)**) to generate TLS traffic.

### **6. Wireshark Captures All Packets**

Wireshark captured:

* TCP handshake
* TLS ClientHello & ServerHello
* Certificate exchange
* Encrypted payload packets

## 🔍 Analysis

### **1. Viewing TLS Handshake**

Using the filter:

```
tls
```

We can observe:

* **ClientHello**: Supported TLS versions, cipher suites
* **ServerHello**: Chosen TLS version and cipher suite
* **Certificate**: Server identity validation
* **Key Exchange Messages**: Used for generating session keys

### **2. Encrypted Application Data**

After the handshake:

* All packets labeled **“Application Data”** are encrypted
* No actual content (credentials, queries) is visible
* Confirms confidentiality provided by TLS

### **3. TCP Layer Analysis**

Before TLS starts, the usual 3-way handshake occurs:

* SYN
* SYN/ACK
* ACK

Useful filters:

```
tcp
tcp.port == 443
ip.addr == <website-ip>
```

### **4. Security Observation**

Although packet metadata (IP, ports, sizes, timings) is visible, **actual content is encrypted**, proving that HTTPS/TLS protects user data from eavesdropping.

## 📝 Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how **Wireshark** can be used to observe TLS-secured HTTPS communication.
Key findings:

* TLS handshake packets (ClientHello, ServerHello, certificates) are visible.
* After handshake completion, all application data becomes **encrypted**, ensuring confidentiality.
* Packet capturing tools can show metadata but **cannot decrypt HTTPS traffic** without session keys.
* This validates the effectiveness of TLS in protecting sensitive information during transmission.

This experiment is essential in cybersecurity education as it helps visualize how
